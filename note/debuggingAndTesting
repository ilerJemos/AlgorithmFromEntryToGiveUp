debugging:
reading
print statement
be systematic

reduce search space
localite the source of problem

Goal:to be bug free

the samplest input provoke the bug
fint he part the code is wrong (binary search)

wrongs:
	order
	spelling
	initialization
	object vs value
	aliasing(别名) deep vs shillow copy

systematic!!!!!!!!!!
mistake model

recommadation:
	keep record what you have tried
	reconsider assumption
	debug conde,not comments
	get help, explain
	walk away
	code should not always grow
	make sure you can revert-save old version


haste makes waste——欲速则不达
